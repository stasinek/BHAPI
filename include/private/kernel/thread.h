/*!	Prepares the current thread for waiting.

	This is the first of two steps necessary to block the current thread
	(IOW, to let it wait for someone else to unblock it or optionally time out
	after a specified delay). The process consists of two steps to avoid race
	conditions in case a lock other than the scheduler lock is involved.

	Usually the thread waits for some condition to change and this condition is
	something reflected in the caller's data structures which should be
	protected by a client lock the caller knows about. E.g. in the semaphore
	code that lock is a per-semaphore spinlock that protects the semaphore data,
	including the semaphore count and the queue of waiting threads. For certain
	low-level locking primitives (e.g. mutexes) that client lock is the
	scheduler lock itself, which simplifies things a bit.

	If a client lock other than the scheduler lock is used, this function must
	be called with that lock being held. Afterwards that lock should be dropped
	and the function that actually blocks the thread shall be invoked
	(thread_block[_locked]() or thread_block_with_timeout()). In between these
	two steps no functionality that uses the thread blocking API for this thread
	shall be used.

	When the caller determines that the condition for unblocking the thread
	occurred, it calls thread_unblock_locked() to unblock the thread. At that
	time one of locks that are held when calling thread_prepare_to_block() must
	be held. Usually that would be the client lock. In two cases it generally
	isn't, however, since the unblocking code doesn't know about the client
	lock: 1. When thread_block_with_timeout() had been used and the timeout
	occurs. 2. When thread_prepare_to_block() had been called with one or both
	of the \c B_CAN_INTERRUPT or \c B_KILL_CAN_INTERRUPT flags specified and
	someone calls thread_interrupt() that is supposed to wake up the thread.
	In either of these two cases only the scheduler lock is held by the
	unblocking code. A timeout can only happen after
	thread_block_with_timeout() has been called, but an interruption is
	possible at any time. The client code must deal with those situations.

	Generally blocking and unblocking threads proceed in the following manner:

	Blocking thread:
	- Acquire client lock.
	- Check client condition and decide whether blocking is necessary.
	- Modify some client data structure to indicate that this thread is now
		waiting.
	- Release client lock (unless client lock is the scheduler lock).
	- Block.
	- Acquire client lock (unless client lock is the scheduler lock).
	- Check client condition and compare with block result. E.g. if the wait was
		interrupted or timed out, but the client condition indicates success, it
		may be considered a success after all, since usually that happens when
		another thread concurrently changed the client condition and also tried
		to unblock the waiting thread. It is even necessary when that other
		thread changed the client data structures in a way that associate some
		resource with the unblocked thread, or otherwise the unblocked thread
		would have to reverse that here.
	- If still necessary -- i.e. not already taken care of by an unblocking
		thread -- modify some client structure to indicate that the thread is no
		longer waiting, so it isn't erroneously unblocked later.

	Unblocking thread:
	- Acquire client lock.
	- Check client condition and decide whether a blocked thread can be woken
		up.
	- Check the client data structure that indicates whether one or more threads
		are waiting and which thread(s) need(s) to be woken up.
	- Unblock respective thread(s).
	- Possibly change some client structure, so that an unblocked thread can
		decide whether a concurrent timeout/interruption can be ignored, or
		simply so that it doesn't have to do any more cleanup.

	Note that in the blocking thread the steps after blocking are strictly
	required only if timeouts or interruptions are possible. If they are not,
	the blocking thread can only be woken up explicitly by an unblocking thread,
	which could already take care of all the necessary client data structure
	modifications, so that the blocking thread wouldn't have to do that.

	Note that the client lock can but does not have to be a spinlock.
	A mutex, a semaphore, or anything that doesn't try to use the thread
	blocking API for the calling thread when releasing the lock is fine.
	In particular that means in principle thread_prepare_to_block() can be
	called with interrupts enabled.

	Care must be taken when the wait can be interrupted or can time out,
	especially with a client lock that uses the thread blocking API. After a
	blocked thread has been interrupted or the the time out occurred it cannot
	acquire the client lock (or any other lock using the thread blocking API)
	without first making sure that the thread doesn't still appear to be
	waiting to other client code. Otherwise another thread could try to unblock
	it which could erroneously unblock the thread while already waiting on the
	client lock. So usually when interruptions or timeouts are possible a
	spinlock needs to be involved.

	\param thread The current thread.
	\param flags The blocking flags. Relevant are:
		- \c B_CAN_INTERRUPT: The thread can be interrupted by any non-blocked
			signal. Implies \c B_KILL_CAN_INTERRUPT (specified or not).
		- \c B_KILL_CAN_INTERRUPT: The thread can be interrupted by a kill
			signal.
	\param type The type of object the thread will be blocked at. Informative/
		for debugging purposes. Must be one of the \c THREAD_BLOCK_TYPE_*
		constants. \c THREAD_BLOCK_TYPE_OTHER implies that \a object is a
		string.
