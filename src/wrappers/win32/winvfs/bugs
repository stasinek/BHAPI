- when we free the last entry in dentry_cache the memory pool gets corrupted.
  (we don't free the last entry now, to avoid this --sadyc)

- dirctl: symbolic links are always threated as files, even if they point to a directory

- problems with device files


BUGURI mascate de cache:

 - deschidere cu VC6
 - cat din mingw nu merg primele cateva
 - intrarea in arhiva



fixed bugs:

- fcb are put in vcb->fcb_list (when allocated in alloc.c) but are not removed at close
(dismount doesn't work if files were opened )  FIXED i think --sadyc
